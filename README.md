# JavaScript Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript:  improper null handling.

The file `bug.js` shows a function that does not explicitly handle null values, leading to potential errors. The file `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version that handles null inputs appropriately, making the function more robust.

Null handling is crucial in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior and errors. Always explicitly check for null values before using them in your code.
